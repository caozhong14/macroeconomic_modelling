# macroeconomic_modelling

The code is used to estimate the macroeconomic burden of disease by quantifying the broader economic impacts of illness on population health, labor supply, and productivity, and translating these impacts into aggregate economic outcomes (e.g., losses in GDP or economic growth).

The code is currently being organized and prepared for public release. If necessary, please contact zhong.cao@uni-heidelberg.de, and we will provide detailed information of how the code is written and implemented.
